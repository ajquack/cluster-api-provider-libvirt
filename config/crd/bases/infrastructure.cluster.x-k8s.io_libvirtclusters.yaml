              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and

                  FailureMessage will be set in the event that there is a terminal problem

                  faces that are expected to be fixed automatically over
                  time (like service outages), but instead indicate that something is
                  fundamentally wrong with the Machine's spec or the configuration of
                  the controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples
                  of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the

                  responsible controller itself being critically misconfigured.

                  can be added as events to the ProxmoxCluster object and/or logged in the
